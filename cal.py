# @Brief:  Implementation of a HomeWork given on date <2026-09-15 Tue>
# @Author: Tejas
# @Date:   2026-09-15 Tue
# @Notice: This was created to demonstrate how I would write the code for the
#          given homeword question.
# ===============================================================================

# NOTE(Tejas): Functions used that maybe unfamilier:
#
# 1. str.center() -> when used with print, str.center can leave a gap of specified
#                    size on either side of the string so that it fits centered
#                    inside a given width (in the param list).
#    used on line numbers: 50
#
# 2. str.lower() -> turns all the char of the string to lower char, ex: A becomes a.
#                   this comes in handy when we compare and dont have to worry
#                   about comparing both lower and upper case variations
#    used on line numbers: 57
#
# 3. str.split() -> this function identifies words seperated by spaces (' ') in
#                   a string and adds them to a list of words.
#                   ex: "this is a string".split() -> ['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']
#    used on line numbers: 65, 77, 98, 124

# TODO(Tejas): For everyone!
# whenever you learn about exception handling I want you to go ahead and handle errors
# casting errors, zerodivied errors. Push it to this repo and if your code is okay
# I will merge it in this repo
